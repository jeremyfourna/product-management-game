* Prior software development knowlegde is not mandatory

# How to win

At the end of the release(s), the player with the most points wins.

## Equality

If players have the same number of points at the end of the game/release, you can decide the winner by following the rules below:

1. The player who has released more features wins
2. The player who has the highest `Team Spirit`
3. The player who released the feature with the highest `Estimation for development`

If players are still equals after that... each player rolls a die, the one with the highest score wins.

Repeat until one player wins.

# Game length

Up to 4 releases.
1 release equals 13 turns (weeks) for each player.

# Setup the game

Place the time marker on week nÂ°1 on the release calendar.

## shuffle the cards

You need to shuffle the following decks of cards:

* Actions
* Features

## Character selection

Each player roll a die. Player select in order the character they wish to incarnate.

### Example

Player A rolls a die... 4. Player B rolls a die... 3. Player C rolls a die... 6.

Player will select their caracters in order

1. Player C select CEO
2. Player A select Developer
3. Player B select Product Manager

## Cards distribution

* Distribute to each player 3 cards `Action`
* Distribute to each player 5 carts `Feature`
  * Player must keep at least 1 card `Feature` to build during the release

## Setup your team

Each player gets at the start of the game:

* 4 developers
* 1 QA

On your `Team Spirit` scale put the marker on the square `N` for neutral.

# Game turn

One turn equals one week in the release.

During a turn each player will plays his/her hand. Player who rolled the highest die during the player selection will start, then player on the left plays.

## Player's turn

During a player's turn we will have the following phases:

1. Player draw an `Action` or a `Feature` card
2. Opponents can mess with the current player by playing `Action`cards. Opponent on the left of the current player start first then the one on his/her left continue until all opponents have played
  * During this phase the player can counters the `Action` cards played by the Opponents if he/she have `Nope` cards in his/her hand
3. Player can, draw a new `Feature` card OR play his/her `Action` cards

When both phases have been played, the player's turn is over. It is now at the player on his/her left to play his/her turn.

## End of the week

Advance features completion
Adjust Team Spirit if devs have nothing to do

# Characters

Each player incarnate a `Character`, each `Character` has its own set of advantages and disadvantages.

## VPP - Vice President of Product

Only 1 player can incarnate the VPP.

Unique skill: 1 time per release, the VPP define for each player the order in which the player must build their features. Example: If a player has 3 features to build for the release (Feature A, B and C), the VPP can decide that feature C must be build first, then feature A and then feature B. If the player do not respect this order, he/she loose the game.
